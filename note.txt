to remote GitHub.com repostiry
Few thing happened:
1. It automatically created new Remote Repo
under your GitHub.com account
2.Made the connection with your local git repo
3.Added all your commits to rfemote repo


Now our work will continue locally:

2.commited the change to local repo
we want this change to be reflected in remote
repository so we PUSHED local commits to remote repository using push irigin button
4.observe it has been added in your repository under GitHub.com
